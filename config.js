	    	'<h2>History</h2>',
	    	'<p>We have been doing JSConf for 5 years with 10 events across the world and every single one has been better than the previous, it is something we take a great deal of pride in. We make events that aren\'t from the standard conference playbook, because we believe you deserve more than that. We have always retained some core concepts, the most fundamental of which is to always focus on the human social development aspect of the event. The second is to always indulge every attendee well beyond that which they have paid. The third is to always treat attendees, staff, sponsors, and speakers with the utmost of respect and appreciation. We have been a launching point for an incredible number of the most revolutionary products, services, and technologies on the web.',
	    	'<p>The JSConf team is constantly working to make the best technology event possible, which means not just creating events, but embracing a mission. Whether it is actively working to fix the diversity in computing issue, help feed the hungry, or try to fix the rampant negativity in our community, we are deeply dedicated making our (and your) world a better place. We want you to be part of it, we want you to be part of the JSConf family and help us with our mission.</p>',

            '<p>The Omni Amelia Island Plantation Resort is on Amelia Island in northeast Florida, just across the St. Marys River from Georgia and adjacent to the historic city of Fernandina. The resort overlooks the azure blue waters of the Atlantic Ocean on the east and the Intracoastal Waterway on the west. Though private, secluded and protected by a gated entry, it is relatively easy to get to.</p>',
			'<p>It is just a short 45 minute drive from downtown Jacksonville, and 29 miles from Jacksonville International Airport. To make your journey to JSConf a little nicer, Nokia is sponsoring airport shuttles to and from Jacksonville International Airport (JAX) and the Omni Amelia Island for you. Please review the schedule below and ensure you understand how this will work before arriving at JAX as you might need to wait for a bus OR find other means of transportation based on your time of arrivals/departures. We have tried to use the information you provided us during activity registration to cover as many people as possible.
